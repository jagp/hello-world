A criminally exciting repository

And thus begins the fascinating story of the most unique of all starting projects, my brilliant creation, the "Hello World!" project.  None similar have come before, and surely none similar shall come to pass after.

In other news, foobar is a candy bar made for fools.

I thank you for your gracious patience during this lengthy and exhaustive readme, and look forward to your continued participation in the selfsame endeavor.  

Please feel free to add as many forks and spoons as you like to this glorious little project!
